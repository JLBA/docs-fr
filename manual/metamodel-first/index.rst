.. _mm_first_index:

The first MetaModel
===================

.. warning:: Under construction!

We want you to have an easy start with MetaModels. To better understand the structure, let's begin with a simple employee list with only very few informations.
Our list shall be filled in the back end and it can be displayed in the front end as a table. To keep it simple in the beginning, we will skip any filtering and sorting options.

The implementation will be guided by the :ref:`component_index`.

**The task:**

* Creation of an employee list which can be maintained in the back end
* Storage of the following values: Last name, first name, email, department
* An additional field to publish a data record
* Output the list as a table in the front end

**Requirements:**

* Actual version of Contao (preferably the LTS version)
* Actual MetaModels - see :ref:`manual_install`
* Familiarity with Contao
* Understanding of :ref:`component_index`
